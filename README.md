Incident information analysis on the terrorist threat in Egypt. 
As a Senior Analyst in the field of international security, I try to be prepared for every-day activities, too. This applies also for holidays and our curiosity for the treasures of Egypt triggered this project. Besides the myths around pyramids, it is the threat posed by terrorists that is well-known about this country. Therefore, I conducted a rigorous analysis on previous incident information which stems from the Global Terrorism Database compiled by the University of Maryland.
